# Cortex RBAC — ServiceAccount + permissions for creating Kubernetes Jobs
# Cortex needs to create and manage Jobs in the thehive namespace to run analyzers.
# Each analyzer runs as a separate K8s Job (one pod per analysis request).
# Without this RBAC, every Cortex analyzer invocation fails silently.
